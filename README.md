# 🧠 Network Intrusion Detection using Decision Tree Classifier

A machine learning model built using IBM Watsonx AutoAI to classify network traffic as benign or malicious.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective
To develop a Snap Decision Tree Classifier for Network Intrusion Detection using IBM Cloud tools only.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- *Training Dataset:* The training dataset consists of labeled network traffic records including both benign and malicious flows. Features include packet duration, source/destination bytes, packet size, flags, and protocol types. This dataset was used to train the Decision Tree Classifier using IBM AutoAI.

- *Testing Dataset:* A separate dataset containing similar types of network traffic was   used to evaluate the model. It was not involved in the training phase, ensuring an unbiased performance assessment.

## 📊 Prediction Results

After training, the Decision Tree model was used to predict network traffic classes (benign or malicious) on the testing dataset.

### Sample Predictions
A few predicted outputs from the model on the test data:
